    *  About this SLIMS installation
       The version of SLIMS installed here is SLIMS 8.3.1, as pulled from Github at build time. Subsequent  modifications are as follows:

    * The SLIMS database, database-user, and database password are installed during the build, and passwords are reinitialise at first boot.
    * As a result, the SLIMS Ezy installer does not run on first use.
    * SLIMS sample data has NOT been imported into the database. However the accompanying  image files etc have been retained in this installation, and users may use the Turnkey Linux Adminer interface to import the sampledata.sql file ( from /var/www/slims8/for_install ) , if they wish.
    * The Library 'admin' user password is set at first boot, and the default password=admin is disabled.
    * The older YAZ4 libraries have been installed , as they are available from the Debian main repository. As a result the Z39.50 Service function operates, although the Z39.50 SRU function may be more reliable.
    * Due to this developer's background and  involvement with Burmese libraries, unofficial "Australian English" and Myanmar language translations have been included. They appear at the bottom of the Available Languages list, to distinguish them from official translations.

 


  * Note: Please refer to turnkey-core's changelog for changes common to all
    appliances. Here we only describe changes specific to this appliance.
